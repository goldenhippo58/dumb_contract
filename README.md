Asynchronous Operations: Full async support for non-blocking contract interactions.
Custom Error Handling: Detailed error types for precise error tracking and debugging.
Testing Utilities: Built-in tools for unit testing your smart contracts locally.
Installation
To include this crate in your Rust project, add the following line to your Cargo.toml file:

toml
Copy code
[dependencies]
smart_contract_crate = "0.1.0"
Getting Started
Example: Deploying and Interacting with a Smart Contract on Binance Smart Chain
This example demonstrates how to deploy a smart contract on Binance Smart Chain and interact with it using the smart_contract_crate.

rust
Copy code
use smart_contract_crate::platforms::binance_smart_chain::BinanceSmartChainContract;
use smart_contract_crate::contract::SmartContract;
use tokio;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize a new Binance Smart Chain contract instance
    let contract = BinanceSmartChainContract::new(
        "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678", // Replace with your contract address
        "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/",          // Binance Smart Chain node URL
    )
    .await
    .expect("Failed to create contract");

    // Deploy the contract
    contract.deploy().expect("Failed to deploy contract");

    // Call a function on the smart contract
    let result = contract.call("some_function", &[]).expect("Failed to call function");
    println!("Function call result: {}", result);

    // Query the smart contract
    let query_result = contract.query("some_query").expect("Failed to query contract");
    println!("Query result: {}", query_result);
}
Platform-Specific Implementations
Ethereum
The Ethereum implementation allows you to deploy, call, and query smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

rust
Copy code
use smart_contract_crate::platforms::ethereum::EthereumContract;
use smart_contract_crate::contract::SmartContract;
use tokio;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let contract = EthereumContract::new(
        "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678", // Ethereum contract address
        "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID", // Infura node URL
    )
    .await
    .expect("Failed to create contract");

    contract.deploy().expect("Failed to deploy contract");
    let result = contract.call("some_function", &[]).expect("Failed to call function");
    println!("Function call result: {}", result);

    let query_result = contract.query("some_query").expect("Failed to query contract");
    println!("Query result: {}", query_result);
}
Solana
The Solana implementation allows you to interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

rust
Copy code
use smart_contract_crate::platforms::solana::SolanaContract;
use solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::signer::keypair::Keypair;
use smart_contract_crate::contract::SmartContract;

fn main() {
    let client = RpcClient::new("https://devnet.solana.com"); // Solana RPC URL
    let payer = Keypair::new();
    let contract = SolanaContract::new("program_id", client, payer);

    contract.deploy().expect("Failed to deploy contract");

    let result = contract.call("some_function", &[]).expect("Failed to call function");
    println!("Function call result: {}", result);

    let query_result = contract.query("some_query").expect("Failed to query contract");
    println!("Query result: {}", query_result);
}
Error Handling
The smart_contract_crate provides a robust error handling mechanism to capture and manage various types of errors that can occur during smart contract operations.

Example: Handling Errors Gracefully
rust
Copy code
use smart_contract_crate::error::ContractError;

fn handle_error() -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    // Example error handling
    let contract_result = some_contract_function();

    match contract_result {
        Ok(_) => println!("Contract function executed successfully."),
        Err(ContractError::NetworkError(e)) => eprintln!("Network error occurred: {}", e),
        Err(ContractError::InvalidAddress(e)) => eprintln!("Invalid contract address: {}", e),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("An unexpected error occurred: {}", e),
    }

    Ok(())
}
Testing Your Smart Contracts
Testing is an essential part of the smart contract development process. This crate provides utilities to help you write and run tests for your smart contracts.

Example: Unit Tests
rust
Copy code
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use smart_contract_crate::platforms::ethereum::EthereumContract;
    use smart_contract_crate::platforms::solana::SolanaContract;
    use smart_contract_crate::platforms::binance_smart_chain::BinanceSmartChainContract;

    #[test]
    fn test_ethereum_deploy() {
        let contract = EthereumContract {
            // Initialize with test data
        };
        assert!(contract.deploy().is_ok());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_solana_deploy() {
        let contract = SolanaContract {
            // Initialize with test data
        };
        assert!(contract.deploy().is_ok());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_bsc_deploy() {
        let contract = BinanceSmartChainContract {
            // Initialize with test data
        };
        assert!(contract.deploy().is_ok());
    }
}
